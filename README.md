# Picocity
The goal: let's make some great games that make PICO more than just a hobby platform. Let’s work together to show people just how AWESOME this platform truly is.

## The Skinny:

We want to make games for Pico-8, and we want to make good, impressive games, that show people just how much creative people can do with harsh limitations. Here’s how we’re set up:

1. `help-wanted`: anyone with a solid concept for a game is free to put their starting project in this folder. This is a place where fellow developer/designers can look at other ideas, and help improve and move them forward.
2. `chiptunes`: this folder is for music that is freely available to use in other Pico games. Feel free to use anything in this folder to improve any of your existing projects.
3. `sfx`: sound effects that are freely available to use in Pico projects.
4. `showcase`: this folder is for finished games. Preferably games that showcase something special about Pico, and help people realize the power in this engine.
